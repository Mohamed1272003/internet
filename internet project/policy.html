            We have a 30-day return policy, which means you have 30 days after receiving your item to request a return.
            To be eligible for a return, your item must be in the same condition that you received it, unworn or unused, with tags,
            and in its original packaging. You’ll also need the receipt or proof of purchase.
            
            To start a return, you can contact us at ETechnology@gmail.com. Please note that returns will need to be sent to the
            following address:
            
            If your return is accepted, we’ll send you a return shipping label, as well as instructions on how and where to send
            your package. Items sent back to us without first requesting a return will not be accepted.
